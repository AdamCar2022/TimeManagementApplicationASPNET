# TimeManagementApplicationASPNET

<b><i><u>Description</u></i></b><br/><br/>
This application is used for time management by storing user module information and then displaying the name of the 
modules that they have entered and the amount of self study hours for that module as well as to show the remaining 
self study hours for a module based on the combobox module name selection and by subtracting the users entered work 
hours for a specific time period.

The application currently only runs on a local database as there was problems uploading the database file to GitHub, therefore
I have provided screenshots of the functionality of the application 

<b><i>Screenshots of pages</i></b><br/><br/>
<b>LOGIN: </b>
This is the login page where the user can login in with the account that they have registered on the web application, from here the user 
can either login in with an existing account or register a new account if they do not have one. The application will also tell the user if the chosen 
username already exists and then it can not be used
